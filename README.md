# HONEYPOT-FARM
Honeypot Farm is a cutting-edge SaaS platform that deploys thousands of virtual honeypots across cloud environments to mislead, trap, and study cyber attackers. By creating a maze of artificial network assets, Honeypot Farm turns your infrastructure into a proactive defense system.

üîê Problem
Traditional cybersecurity tools focus on detection and response. However, attackers are becoming more sophisticated, using AI and quantum-resistant techniques to bypass defenses. Organizations need deceptive environments that confuse and slow down attackers while gathering actionable intelligence.

‚úÖ Your Docker setup for running HashiCorp Vault in development mode is added to Docker files: 

üß™ How to Use
1. Build and start Vault:
1. docker-compose up --build -d

2. Access Vault UI or CLI:
    ‚Ä¢ Web UI: http://localhost:8200
    ‚Ä¢ CLI:
    ‚Ä¢ export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
vault status

3. Store secrets:
3. vault kv put secret/honeypotfarm DB_PASSWORD=secure123 API_KEY=abc123


‚úÖ Vault initialization and AppRole setup are now automated for the Honeypot Farm container.
üìÑ Download the updated files:
‚Ä¢ Dockerfile
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml
These files now support:
‚Ä¢ Auto-initialization of Vault on container startup
‚Ä¢ Unsealing and login with root token
‚Ä¢ Enabling KV secrets engine
‚Ä¢ Creating a read-only policy for honeypotfarm
‚Ä¢ Configuring AppRole and saving ROLE_ID and SECRET_ID to files

Your backend is now configured to automatically inject secrets from Vault using AppRole credentials stored in container-mounted files.
üìÑ Updated files:
‚Ä¢ Dockerfile
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml
‚∏ª
üîß How It Works
‚Ä¢ On backend startup, it reads ROLE_ID.txt and SECRET_ID.txt from the Vault container.
‚Ä¢ Authenticates with Vault using AppRole.
‚Ä¢ Retrieves secrets from secret/data/honeypotfarm.
‚Ä¢ Injects them as environment variables for use in your FastAPI app.

‚úÖ Error handling has been added to the Vault secret injection process in Honeypot Farm's backend.
üìÑ Updated files:
‚Ä¢ Dockerfile
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml
‚∏ª
üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Features
‚Ä¢ Logs if Vault is unreachable
‚Ä¢ Logs if AppRole credentials are missing or unreadable
‚Ä¢ Logs if authentication fails
‚Ä¢ Logs if secrets cannot be retrieved
‚Ä¢ Gracefully exits without crashing the backend

‚úÖ Honeypot Farm's backend is now configured to send logs to a centralized logging system.
üìÑ Updated files:
‚Ä¢ Dockerfile
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml
‚∏ª
üß† Supported Logging Backends
‚Ä¢ ELK Stack: via Syslog (LOGGING_BACKEND=elk)
‚Ä¢ Loki: via HTTP push (LOGGING_BACKEND=loki)
üîß Environment Variables
Set these in your .env or deployment config:
LOGGING_BACKEND=loki
LOGGING_HOST=localhost
LOGGING_PORT=3100

üìù Logs Sent
‚Ä¢ Vault secret injection status
‚Ä¢ Authentication success/failure
‚Ä¢ Errors and warnings
